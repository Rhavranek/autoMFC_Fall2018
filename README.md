# autoMFC_Fall2018

### This is the repo of the "final" of my project for Computational Tools, Fall 2018
There are two primary code projects:

  1. Work I've done to integrate both a photon microcontroller and an arduino microcontroller with 2 Sierra Instruments Mass Flow controllers and a Valco multiport valve. This work is being done to add remote control capabilites to the lab work I'm doing. This will help me complete experiments in a more time efficient manner, and will make them more manualized. In the code folder you will find this work under "arduino_to_photon" and "photon_functions"

  2. I have also worked to integrate "Code" I know works (the Valco valve rotation) with a real time clock. This will help me create a manualized sampling system in the field. In the "Code" folder, this work can be found under "Combining_RTC_valco".
